# 📊 Linear Regression from Scratch in Python

This repository contains foundational machine learning projects focused on implementing **linear** and **logistic regression** without using high-level ML libraries like scikit-learn. These projects were developed to deeply understand the mathematics and mechanics behind regression models.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1. Linear Regression (Univariate)
- Predicts restaurant profits based on city population.
- Implements cost function and **gradient descent** optimization from scratch.
- Plots loss curves and regression line using **Matplotlib**.
